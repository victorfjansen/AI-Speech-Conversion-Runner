# TODO
### To run this project, you should clone every model repository here.
### For this POC, i'm using three different models of Whisper AI.

<hr/>

## To clone, just follow the steps:
- Create a folder named "models";
- Inside of this folder, clone the following repositories:
- git clone https://huggingface.co/onnx-community/whisper-base
- git clone https://huggingface.co/onnx-community/whisper-tiny
- git clone https://huggingface.co/onnx-community/whisper-large-v3-turbo
